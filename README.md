Hello. Welcome to my website.

I am Natalie Gichuki a current student at Moringa School taking the Fullstack Web Development course.

This is my first project built from scratch using HTML CSS and a bit of styles from Bootstrap.

It is a hotel website that showcases the services offered from accommodation to meals and fun activities.
It has an about sections that explains all about the Hotel. Also i included a contact us section where the customer can fill in their details and seek clarification from the hotel management team.

Thank you for visiting my site.
